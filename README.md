# My simple LeetCode record

This repo is a collection of LeetCode problems that I found either interesting, or learnt a lot from.

The codes would typically include the data structure/algorithm used, and my thought process.

Files are directly exported to pdf from Obsidian.

All problems are solved using Python3.

*(I will add some content page here when I have time...)*

*\~Happy Coding!\~*
